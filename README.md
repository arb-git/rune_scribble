# Rune-Scribble-Project 
Based on Flask-Cnn-Recognition-App

Current features:
- Allows drawing on a canvas of the home page
- When clicking "Submit", redirect to another page,
    showing the original drawing / scribble and its 
    processed version.
- At the moment, the processing is trivial:
    changing RGB color scheme to BGR.
